# Tilda

## Driver

Tilda allows you to mock your http dependencies during development time. 

This is especially helpful when:
1. an external dependency is unstable or unreachable during developing
1. the response you are solving for is difficult to set up

You can approximate your dependency with Tilda.

## Usage

### Container

Set up a container using docker compose by following [this guide](./documentation/as-container/README.md).

### Running locally

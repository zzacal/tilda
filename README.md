# Tilda

## Driver

Tilda allows you to mock your http dependencies during development time. 

This is especially helpful when:
1. an external dependency is unstable or unreachable during developing
1. the response you are solving for is difficult to set up

You can approximate your dependency with Tilda.

## Usage

You can use tilda by running it as either a container or a local process.

### Container

Set up a container using docker compose by following [this guide](./documentation/as-container/README.md).

### Running locally

Start a process locally by following [this guide](./documentation/as-process/README.md)
